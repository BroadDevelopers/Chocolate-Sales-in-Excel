1. We want to build an information finder for if we type in an employee
we will see the entire details for that indiidual.
-This type of operation is called looking up: We can use the "lookup" function for this
-Two types of Lookup function:

we want to look up : Barr Faughny

a.XLOOKUP
Lets say the name is in cell: L17
=XLOOKUP(Name,Table where the name is-column, What we want want from the table)
=XLOOKUP(L17,STAFF[Name],Staff[[Gender]:[Tenure]])
we can put the Xloopup inside of transpose in order to view the retrieved information in a vertical manner
TRANSPOSE(XLOOKUP())
This is dynamic, if you want to find another individuals details, you just type in their name on L17 cell

b.VLOOKUP
vlookip(position of name : L7, table ,which column: 7, exact match: False)
=VLOOKUP(L17,staff,7,FALSE)



- we can also do it manually by just filtering from the name column
but this is too manual if the name changes you have to change the filter again
