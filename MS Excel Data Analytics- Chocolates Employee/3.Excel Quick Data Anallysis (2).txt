1. Quick analysis of the data to understand what we got from the combined data
- we can do this with :
a. Pivot tables
or
b. Formulas

2.-We will be using formulas in order to learn excel functions.
we are going to build our formulas on the same page as the combined data 
but it is adviced to build this on a seperate page or tab.

The things we want to calculate are:
a.Count of employess
two functions we can use:
Count-for integers
CountA-for string
=COUNTA(click on name column)

b.average salary
=Average(Salaryy Column)
c.Average age
d.Average Tenure(Tenure is how long an employee has been working with us by using joined date)
add a tenure column to the table- write tenure to the end of the table and hit enter
Tenure is= Current date(Using today() funtion) - joined date
the tebure will be interms of date, but we can select the column and change the formato to general
Home->Number->General but we want to get years so its going to be

=(Today()-Date Joined)/365=year=change to number formatting

e. Female ratio %
well do this in two steps:
first we want to know how many gender counts are females using COUNTIFS function.
COUNTIFS(staff[Gender],"Female") = count
Ration= female count/count of employees(Ctrl + Shift + 5 to apply percentage on this)
