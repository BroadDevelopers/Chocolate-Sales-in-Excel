 1. Information Finder Version 2.0
if we provide a department name we would like to see:
a.who is workking in the depaartment
b.What are their salaries
c. Age etc
in a seperate tab

on our excel sheet.
- If we put a department name in the cell we would like to see:
a.The people working in the department
b.Their salary
c.What is their rate 
in a descending order, the highest salary at the top and the lowest to the bottom
apart from that we want to know how many people are there
We will use filter function-in my excel is myfilter

C5 in thr video case is the "SALES"
=FILTER(staff, staff[Department]=C5)- thhis is going to return values only from the sales department
But we dont want all the columns,
we want the name, salary and rating column, so we are goint to number all the columns
-so we want column 1,4 and 7 of the data

instead of filtering , we want to choose the columns using "CHOOSE FUNCTION"
=CHOOSECOLS(FILTER(),1,7,4)
This will shrick the table and rearrange in this order
Once this is in, we want to sort the data by the highest salary, so that, the highest salary goes to the top
using the "SORT" function. by the second(2)Column(salary) in descending order(which is: -1)
=SORT(CHOOSECOLS(FILTER();1;4;7);2;-1)

WE'd now like to count the number of people which are there
=COUNTIFS(staff[Department],sales/B5)
