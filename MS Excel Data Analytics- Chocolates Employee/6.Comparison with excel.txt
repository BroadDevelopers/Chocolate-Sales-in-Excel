- We would like to do a quick male vs female comparison
-And understand how many people are there based on these gender groups
-what is their average age/salary/......
-We can't use formulas to do this as we have already use formulas

-so we are going to use pivot tables for this analysis:
a. Go to the dataset->click any cell->insert(navbar)->
Pivot Tables
-Window:Existing worksheet/new worksheet->(check)Add data to the data models(This enables some important feautures in our pivot table that helps us answer some important wuestions quickly)
-click ok

A pivot Table Canvas will appear.
-A field option(Name,Gender,Age,Rating) will appear which we can use to construct the table
-Pivot Table is a quick and easy reporting system, these can be used to answer business quetions or build reports quickly

-On OUR pivot table we want:
a.Two columns: One for male and one for female
b.Then we would like to see how many people are there and what is their average age etc

1.-Columns Field: Insert Gender
we now want to see how many people are the, it could be a count on the name coulumn
2. Values Field : Insert Name - This will count the name
now we want to count the Average age
3.Values Field : Insert Age
by default excel is going to sum the age of females and males because age is in a number format
The sum is useless so we are going to change it to average
right click on the sum age cell->summarize values by-> Average


We can see that the table is growing horizontally but what we want is
count in one row and average in next row.
-in the columns field->drag values to rows

4. inset salary into the values field->summarize by average
5. Insert tenure inside values field

--Now that we have all the information--
Lets see how we can remove all the other genders and remain with male and female
-To do this:
click on the column labels arrow on the table->>uncheck the other genders

6. Now we want to apply some quick formatting
right click the cell you want to format(eg aerage age of female)->number formatt->number->1 decimal place->click ok

7. IF you dont want the grand total
Click the column->Design->Grand total->Off for row and columns

8 Now we want to create a slicer from the country option
country->right click->add as a slicer
