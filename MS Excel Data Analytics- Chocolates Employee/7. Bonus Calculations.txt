Bonus Calculation.
We will do all of this on our ALL staff data

-We would like to give 3% bonus on salary, so whatever is your salary
your bonus will be 3% of that assuming you have be with the organization for
at least 2 years, if not your bonus will be 2%.

- We can calculate the new bonus as a new column.
if tenure>2 then bonus =3% else 2%
= IF([@Tenure]>2, 3%,2%)
Then we take the percentage and multiply by the salary
= IF([@Tenure]>2, 3%,2%)*staff[@salary]
-We can roundup to no more deciamal point/zero(0)
=ROUNDUP(IF([@Tenure]>2, 3%,2%)*staff[@salary],0)
apply the currency formatting
then remove the zeros 

1. What if the manager come and ask for the people who had the top ten bonuses
we can write calculation
but the fastest way is to:
Go to the Bonus arrow->Number Filters->Top 10
