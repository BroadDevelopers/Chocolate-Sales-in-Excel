1. Understanding salary spread using histograms and box plots
A.
how to do this:
-Select Salary column->Home->conditional formatting->Color Scale->Green:high salaries to Red:low salries
but we are going to use-> blue to red.
-to get s visual sense-> we are goign to sort _>smallest to largest

NEXT STEP WITH THE SALARY is to STATISTICALLY DO THE ANALYSIS
-select salary column->insert(NavBar)->charts->statistics chart->histogram
this will give a histogram of our salary spread
-We are going to remove the x-axis because it has no meaning
x-axis->ctrl 1(to format it)->  change from automatic bins to bin-width:10 000->Underflow-bin:40 000
what this will do is this the distribution will go from 40-50,50-60....

b.What else can we do to understand the salary spread
select salary column->insert->charts->box plot
-This show the entrire salary in a box plot diagram.
- We we will cut the box plot(box and whisker) and paste onto the salary spread sheet and explain what it is trying to do
-Box Plot shows:
The entire salary as a box, with the up and below whiskers, 
The middle line inside the box: is the median
The X mark inside the box: is the Average
-The box above the midpoint/media is the 75th percentile
The box below the midpoint is the 25th percentile
-Make sure on the formatting that "show outlier" is checked

2. Salary Vs Rating
-Now lets answer the next question, is there a relationship between the ratings and the salary of an employee
-We are going to do this in two ways, through:
a. Pivot Table
add new worksheet->salary vs rating
select All staff table->inserrt(navbar)->pivot table
insert rating into-> rows, name ->values, salary->values
on pivot table->right click sum of salary-> change into average salary
drag exception aboe, above average
apply number formatting to average salary-> o decimal places-> tot see the numbers better
-on the average salary->navbar(home)->conditional formatting->Data Bar->Blue Data Bar->

b.Chart
-Since we our ratings are text, we need to map them to numeric values
1.Copy all the rating on a new worksheet
Exceptional 5
Above average 4
Average 3
Poor 2
Very poor 1
-Then we are going to creaate a new column called "Rating as a number" on the ALL staff table
then we are going to calculate what is rating as a number using XLOOKUP
XLOOKUP(click-average(ALLstaff),select(new woeksheet)ratings as text, select(workshhet)ratings as numebrs)
then press f4 to change the formatting to $B$3, gor worksheet ratings
format by removing the zeros
- Now that we have salary as a number and rating as number:
A quick way to visualize this is to use a scatter plot
select the salary colunm hold ctrl select the rating column-Insert(Navbar)
->scatter plot-Cut it(ctrl + X) ->move to our pivot table(rating vs salary)

3.Number Of People-> How has our company grown in terms of number of people
-We would like to see a trend of date joint and how many people have joined on each date as a trend
-One simple way to do this is to take the date joined and then plot the hed count againgst it we will get an idea
but this is not going to give us much, istead
we are going to use pivot tables and build thhis slowly
-Well start by insterting a pivot table from our data model
-we will be using the ALL staff table
Rows:date joined
Names:Values
insert a line chart: The problem with the line chart is that it doesnt show the growth of the company
- A good way to visualiza what we want is to get cumulative totals
that is running total of numbers over the entire period of time
-right click on the count name->show values as->Running total in

we are goign to calculate our running total:
Month
Headcount
Running totals. 
those are our columns.
Month
