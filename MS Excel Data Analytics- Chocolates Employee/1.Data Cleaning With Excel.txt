NEWZWLAND STAFF TABLE
1.Turn the data into tables.
change name of table->design->table name(Navbar):Newzeland Staff
Click on any cell->Ctrl+A->Then Ctrl+T(for table)
2.Make the table display averages.
Clcick a cell-> Navbar-design->Click "total row"
3.Get Averages.
-On the bottom of the page go to:
salary and filter on the total to averages, then change the values to
dollars by Cntl+Shift+4
-Get the average age
4.Dates
Some of the date is in number format and this is because by default excel stores date data in number format
what it means is the data is 44446 days since the start of excel calendar
excel cander starts on 1st of jabuary 1900
- select all the number formated date -> presss-> Ctrl+Shift+3 to turn into date formatting
5. Data Cleaning : Finding duplicate entries
-We can tell if a name has repeated or not using a fileter
This i where we need to pick the entrire column by just hovering on the column until we see a black mouse cursor
then click to select the column:
-> go to "HOME"->condional formatting->Highlight cells Rules->Duplicate Values
The red highlighted values will be the duplicates

How do we fix this?:
Highlight one set of the duplicates(But we do still need to keep one of these rows but we can delete the second occurance),
we can do this manually by using the "Data -ribbon remove duplicate" but we are not going to use this because we need to solve
this problem for both newzeland staff data and indian staff data

6.Combining all the data(Power Query)
Now we are going to combine indian and newzeland data into one consolidated table
this will be the table we will use to do our data analysis
TO DO THIS:
Data(Navbar)->Get and Transform Data(PowerQuery ).

1st: Lets load the NWZ data into power_query
 select any cell->Data->Data and transformation->From Table/Range
This will load our table into powerquery
-PowerQuery is a Data Preprocessing Engine that we can use to tell eexcel:
a. How we would like our data to be clean
b.What additional operations we want to do on our data etc
- We now have the NWZ data in power query now we would like to add the indian data into power query so that we can combine
both of the data
-On the left-queries:duplicate the nzw data
-In the duplicate nzw data: in the formulae bar where it saays:
Click source: Then change on the formulae bar:
= Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name="NZW_staff"]}[Content]
to
= Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name="india_staff"]}[Content]

--Before we combine the data lets add a column in the nwz data to show that this is actually newzeland people
to do this:
Navbar-Add-column->Custom Column->New Column name: Country->Custom column formulae:NZ->press ok
this is a way to make us know that this is newzeland data
-- Do the same for indian data

--Now we have two tables but we want one table by combining the tables
Appendic Operation: An operation where you take twodata sets with similar column structure
and append them, one underneth another.
Nacbar->Home->append queries dropdown->append queries as new
->First_table:indian staff->Second_table:nwz_staff-> press ok

A third appended query will form called apend_one->rename to staff.

7. Data Cleaning in Power Query just after appending the tables.
-1st Cleanup Activity: Check the first column(Name) for duplicates
to do this:
select the column->right_click->Remove Duplicate
(This could be dangerous in large datasets, in a large company there may be individual with the same name but in this data theres only one individual
if you have such a duplication you might want to pick a column like employee_id/or any other number to remove duplicates)

2nd: Dealing with "Null" gender values
Every time a gender value is missing we want to put the value as other genders
To do this:
-We can use a replacement type of step with in powerquery:
select genedr column->right click:replace vales-> value to find: null-> Replace with:Other

3rd: Now we are going to look at the date joined column
The green bar doesn't go all the way to the end indicating that there is a blank valeu
There is somebody without a date joint(Null from the drop down menu)
In a data analysis view point, if an employee doesnt have a date, they shouldnt ven be in our data
-Unslect everything and click the null value- this is due to our grand total row
from applied steps, remove filter step and uncheck the null value

At this point this is our final data, this is the data we can go and do our data analysis on.

Home->Close and Load to....->only create a connection-Press ok
this will load all the queries.

Now creat a new tab in excel called : ALL Staff-> Right click->change color to yellow
in ALL Staff we want to load the staff table there so we are going to do this by
right click on "staff"->load to...->select how you want....:Table->Where do you want to put...?:Existing worksheet:

editing the date in power query
right click staff->edit->right click date->Change type:Date->close and load
